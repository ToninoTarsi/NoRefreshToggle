NoRefreshToggle (or simply NoRefresh) is a screen refresh controller app for
the Nook Simple Touch E-Ink screen. Basically, it manages switching easily
between "normal" and "A2" refresh modes to allow 1-bit fast animations for any
android app without source code modification. Ideally, each app should be natively
"ported" to manage e-ink screen updates accordingly, but this may be time-consuming,
difficult or even impossible if the app is closed source, which means very often.

Building should be straightforward enough, requiring Android SDK and NDK.
